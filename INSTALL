** Building and installing HaskellDirect

- cabal install hcom (for the support libraries)

Extra goodies:
 
- to install the HDirect libraries (the generic and/or the COM
  specific ones) as GHC packages, you need to 'cd' into lib
  (and comlib/, if needs be), and 'make install-pkg'. This rule
  assumes that GHC_PKG refers to the ghc_pkg util that goes with
  the HC you configured in config.mk
  
  Upon successful completion, the generic HDirect libraries will
  be available as package 'hdirect', and the COM libraries as 'com'.

  The packages are useable from within GHCi and in batch-mode.

- to have HDirect support the reading (and writing) of COM type
  libraries, you need to 'make' src/ with SUPPORT_TYPELIBS=YES.
  This assumes that you already have a compiled up version of the
  HDirect COM library, which you clearly won't have initially.
  Hence, you need to either do a second clean build of the
  HDirect sources, or just make sure you re-make src/ after
  having built comlib/...here's how to do the latter:
  
    ...unpack sources and tailor config.mk ..
    foo$ make
    ..
    foo$ make lib
    foo$ cd comlib/
    foo$ make install-pkg GHC_PKG=/path/to/your/ghc/bin/ghc-pkg
    foo$ cd ../src
    foo$ rm -f *.o
    foo$ make depend SUPPORT_TYPELIBS=YES
    foo$ make SUPPORT_TYPELIBS=YES
